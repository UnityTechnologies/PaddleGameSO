  m_Description: 'This event channel broadcasts from a single ObjectiveSO to notify
    any listeners (the ObjectiveManager) that the objective is complete. The ObjectiveManager
    can then check all objectives to verify that all are complete.


    Though not
    used in this demo, you can modify each objective to be optional or be able to
    fail. This allows you to create primary and secondary/optional objectives to
    enhance gameplay.'
