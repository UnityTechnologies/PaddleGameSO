  - 'ScriptableObjects can contain more than just data. They also can hold methods
    and logic, which can help implement certain design patterns.


    Moving a specific
    block of logic from a MonoBehaviour into a ScriptableObject can make that behavior
    more modular.


    In this way, the ScriptableObject acts like a delegate object.
    Think of it as a bundle of logic that works in context of another script.'
  - 'Each corner of this screen contains an AudioSource and a custom <b>AudioModifier</b>.


    Click
    <b>Select Sources</b> to cycle through the available AudioSources.


    The
    AudioModifiers create variations in sound simply by referencing different ScriptableObjects.


    An
    abstract base class (or interface) ensures compatibility. Any subclass of the
    delegate object can work with the AudioModifier. '
  - 'This design allows you to keep the core logic (the MonoBehaviour) the same while
    offloading an algorithm to another object (the ScriptableObject).


    For example,
    imagine switching to different pathfinding or AI routines depending on game conditions.


    Storing
    logic within a ScriptableObject is also part of other patterns, such as event
    channels and runtime sets.'
