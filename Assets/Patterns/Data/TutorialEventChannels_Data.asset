  m_BodyText:
  - "ScriptableObject-based events can help your GameObjects communicate. These \"event
    channels\" act as intermediaries between the broadcasting objects and their listeners.\n\nClick
    the <b>Raise Event</b>  button to raise the event. \n\nOnly subscribed listeners
    show the effect. This button can help debug gameplay logic at runtime."
  - "This pattern decouples the <b>Broadcaster</b> from the <b>Listeners</b>. Changes
    to either set of GameObjects does not affect the other. \n\nThe <b>Broadcaster</b>
    raises the event on the event channel and is unaware of any objects that are
    listening.\n"
  - "For debugging, the event channel uses the <b> Delegate.GetInvocationList</b>
    method to display a list of active listeners.  \n\nSelect each listening object
    from the ListView to locate it in the Hierarchy.\n\nNote that any object can
    function as a Broadcaster or Listener depending on context."
