  m_BodyText:
  - 'A <b>runtime set</b> is a ScriptableObject that can store a List. This can provide
    access to frequently referenced components or GameObjects at runtime.


    The
    ScriptableObject data in this case is not static. The runtime set includes logic
    to update dynamically.


    Click the <b>Spawn Block</b> button to create an
    object.'
  - 'Click the <b>Select Set</b> to inspect the <b>BlockRuntimeSet_Data</b> ScriptableObject.


    Because
    the data is located on an asset, its public List of <b>Items</b> is accessible
    at any time.


    This can help reduce the need for singletons in your project,
    improving testability and modularity.'
  - "The runtime set raises an event when changes occur to the <b>Items</b> list.
    \n\nIn this example, the <b>BlockRuntimeSetUpdated_SO</b> event channel notifies
    the  on-screen label to update whenever a block is created or destroyed."
  - "A custom Editor script shows the list of GameObjects in the runtime set. \n\nThis
    replaces the default Inspector, which normally displays a 'Type mismatch' when
    referencing a Scene object from a project asset. \n\nSelect an element from the
    ListView to locate it in the Hierarchy."
